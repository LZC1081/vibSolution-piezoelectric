# vibSolution-piezoelectric
#The solver aims to solve the eigenfrequencies and the corresponding modal shapes of piezoelectric components(beams for instance), by comparing the eigenfrequencies of beams with/without the deployment of electrodes, it is possible to determine how well the electro-mechanical coupling is for the component.
